> **Forked from [rmcew/disc-tool](https://github.com/rmcew/disc-assessment-tool)**  
> This version includes major upgrades and enhancements. See [Changes in This Fork](#changes-in-this-fork) for details.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: The tool supports a variety of languages. Language sets can be found in the `static/languages` directory. Each language is represented by a folder named with its language code (e.g., `en` for English, `ru` for Russian).

- **Easy Language Addition**: To add a new language, simply create a new folder in the `static/languages` directory with the appropriate language code and fill out each file that is present in other languages. Additionally, remember to update the new language code in the JSON object located at `static/languages/list.json`.

- **Export Results**: Once the assessment is completed, users can export their results to a PDF file, which can be downloaded and shared with others.
